# COP3223_HW6
## In this hw, you are asked to write a C program that loads an array of integers (scores obtained by students in a test) and prints a report showing the following: 
### 1)  How many students passed the test (passing a test is getting a score of 70 or higher) 
### 2)  Print a report like the one shown in the sample run, a report that shows how many received the grade of A, B, C, D and F. The standard letter grade scale is used-See sample run. 
### 3)  Compute the standard deviation of the scores. The Standard deviation of N scores can be obtained using the formula: Where the Standard Deviation is denoted by ÔÅ≥, the average score is denoted by  a, and N is the number of scores you loaded in the array.
